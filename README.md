# TS Tag Creator

A tool to create timestamps, where it saves in a json file or another format. Timestamps consist of start time and end time.

It's just a prototype still in development and a lot can change. 

# How to use

- Click **"CHOOSE FILE"** and select a video on your device, it will be loaded on the page. 
- Here you will have the player option normally, you will have to press **"Add"** to add a timestamp. The program will automatically organize by time, the first being the start time and the second the end time.

You can also clear all timestamps by clicking **"clear"**.
